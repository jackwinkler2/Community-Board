## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had a lot of syntactical challenges especially with the css components as I wanted to try lots of different styles, and I had to learn new methods structuring components. This was my first time using .map for the club cards, to get them layedout, and I also had to learn to use display: grid for the css to get them in a 3 by 4 format.
